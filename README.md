# 🐛 Bug Busters Debugging Challenge Game

An interactive algorithm debugging quiz game where you identify bugs in classic algorithms through multiple-choice questions!

## 🎮 Game Features

- **20 Algorithm Challenges** with intentional bugs to identify
- **Multiple Choice Questions** - Select the correct bug from 4 options
- **Randomized Options** - Answer positions change each time for variety
- **Scoring System** - Earn points for correct answers
- **Timer** - Track how fast you solve all challenges
- **Hint System** - Get help when stuck (costs 5 points)
- **Interactive Feedback** - Visual animations for success and errors
- **Auto-progression** - Automatically moves to next challenge after correct answer

## 🧠 Algorithm Challenges (20 Total)

### Searching & Sorting:
1. **Binary Search** - Index out of bounds bug
2. **Bubble Sort** - Wrong comparison operator
3. **Quick Sort Partition** - Incorrect pivot placement
4. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays** - Missing remaining elements
5. **Linear Search** - Missing return statement
6. **Selection Sort** - Broken swap logic
7. **Insertion Sort** - Wrong loop condition

### Arrays & Strings:
8. **Array Maximum** - Wrong initialization
9. **Find Minimum** - Wrong initialization
10. **Array Sum** - Not accumulating properly
11. **Count Occurrences** - Counter not updating
12. **Remove Duplicates** - Logic error
13. **Reverse String** - Missing pointer decrement
14. **Is Palindrome** - Case sensitivity issue
15. **String Contains** - Misplaced return statement
16. **Two Sum Problem** - Using same element twice
17. **Array Rotation** - Index calculation error

### Recursion:
18. **Fibonacci Sequence** - Off-by-one error
19. **Factorial Calculation** - Wrong base case
20. **Power Function** - Missing base case

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click **"Start Challenge"** to begin
3. Read the algorithm description, test case, and buggy code
4. Select the option (A, B, C, or D) that correctly identifies the bug
5. Click **"Submit Answer"** to check your selection
6. Earn points for correct answers, lose points for wrong ones
7. Use **"Get Hint"** if you're stuck (costs 5 points)
8. Complete all 20 challenges to see your final score!

## 🏆 Scoring

- **Correct Answer**: +20 points
- **Wrong Answer**: -5 points (can retry)
- **Using Hint**: -5 points

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

- **Randomized Options**: Each time you load or refresh a challenge, the correct answer appears in a different position (A, B, C, or D)
- **Visual Feedback**: Correct answers show in green, wrong answers show in red
- **Timer**: Tracks total time from start to finish
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows current challenge number (e.g., "5/20")
